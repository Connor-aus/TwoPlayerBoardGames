-- How to Play:

The game will ask you to make a move, undo a move, redo a 
move, save the game, or quit.

Making a move will prompt you for a row and column number. 
These values will correspond with the numbers you can see 
along the top and bottom of the board.

If you enter them incorrectly, you will be asked to 
re-enter a valid selection.

Don't worry! If you enter a move that was a mistake then 
you will have the option to undo your move, or redo a move 
if you have undone too many.

The game can be saved at any point for later use.

Quitting will quit the game.


-- Rules:

Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color on 
an empty position. Black plays first. The winner is 
the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones 
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
